# MachineLearning_1

We are given data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell for 6 participants. Our training data consists of a label identifying the quality of the exercise. The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, meaning predict the labels for the test set observations.

The HTML file is a report describing how I built a random forest and then predicts 20 different test cases.
Background

###Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
